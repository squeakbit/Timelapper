 * Bridges the CPU-awake gap between [AlarmReceiver] firing and the service
 * it starts actually finishing its work. The timeout passed to [acquire] is
 * only a safety-net ceiling (in case something hangs, e.g. a stuck network
 * call) - the normal path is for the service to call [release] itself the
 * moment its work completes, so the device isn't kept awake any longer than
 * actually necessary.
